## WIP

A stupid simple warp-dir/directory bookmark replacement.

I'm mostly writing this to learn Zig, but it already does a better job than, e.g., the Ruby warp-dir which messes up on "~" in directory names, probably trying to expand them.

```shell
$ zig build
$ zig-out/bin/wdz --help
```

This is far from done. I'm still messing around.
